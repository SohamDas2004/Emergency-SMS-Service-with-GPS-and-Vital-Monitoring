# Emergency-SMS-Service-with-GPS-and-Vital-Monitoring

The wearable integrates multiple biomedical sensors, including blood pressure (BP) sensors, SpO2 sensors. These sensors continuously monitor the user’s vital signs, which are processed by an ESP32 microcontroller. The system is further integrated with Goole Cloud’s Geolocation API to provide real-time location data. When the SOS button is pressed, the system triggers an automatic emergency alert service.

The alert system is connected to Google Cloud Platform, which    provides reliable GPS coordinates       of the mother. Using APIs such as Twilio, SMS alerts with vital readings and location details are sent to the nearest hospital or healthcare provider. This ensures quick response and potentially life-saving interventions for pregnant         women in rural settings.
